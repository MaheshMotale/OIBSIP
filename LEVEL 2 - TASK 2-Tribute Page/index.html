                <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, quite simply, the most popular
                    playback singer in Bollywood's history. She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to
                    Preity G Zinta, as well as recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc). Until the 1991 edition,
                    when her entry disappeared, the Guinness Book of World Records listed her as the most-recorded
                    artist in the world with not less than 30,000 solo, duet,and chorus-backed songs recorded in 20
                    Indian languages between 948 and 1987. Today that number may have reached 40,000!

                <h2>Childhood and Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar was noted for her distinctive voice and vocal range that
                    extended over more than three octaves.

                    She was born on 28 September 1929 in Indore, India. She was the eldest of five siblings. Her father
                    was Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar and her mother was Shevanti. His father was a noted Marathi stage
                    personality popularly known as Master Dinanath.

                    She was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 13, she recorded her first song for
                    Vasant Joglekars Marathi film Kiti Hasaal.

                    Lata Mangeshkar's birth name was "Hema". Later, her parents renamed her name and kept it, Lata,
                    after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, BhaawBandhan. Her siblings' names in
                    birth order are Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath. All are accomplished singers and musicians. Her

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    He joined Tata Sons in 1962, where he worked on the floor. It was a strenuous and difficult job, but
                    he gained experience and understanding of the family business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1971, he was made Director-in-charge of the NELCO (National Radio and Electronics Company Ltd).
                    The company was going through a financial crisis phase. Ratan Tata worked hard to build an improved
                    consumer electronics division, but the economic recession and Union issues did not prove successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1977, he was transferred to Empress Mills, another struggling Tata Group unit. He made a plan for
                    the mill’s revival, but the other company executives rejected it, and the mill was shut down. Ratan
                    Tata was yet again moved to Tata Industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1991, JRD Tata appointed Ratan Tata the Chairman of the Tata Group. There were objections from
                    other executives amid concern regarding his ability to manage the responsibilities. Once at the Tata
                    Group’s helm, Ratan Tata successfully improved the organisation’s overall position. He modified the
                    management and vision of the division and also managed to increase the dividends. During this
                    period, he was also a Prime Minister’s Council on Trade and Industry member. He was on the advisory
                    board of the RAND for the Asia Pacific Policy.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also a member of the Mitsubishi corporation international advisory board, JP Morgan Chase,
                    Booz Allen Hamilton, and the American International Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In December 2012, on his 75th birthday, Ratan Tata resigned as chairman of Tata Group. Cyrus Mistry,
                    the Managing Director of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, became the new chairman of the Tata Group. He
                    acted as the interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Retirement does not hold him back as he still actively invests in new promising business ventures.
                    He is a dedicated philanthropist and contributes significantly to various charities in the country.
